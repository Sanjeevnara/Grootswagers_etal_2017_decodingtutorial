# Description

This repository contains the code that was used for the figures in the time-series decoding tutorial, which can be found at:
http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn_a_01068

# Disclaimer

The code was specifically created for the paper, and is provided here for archiving purposes only. It has minimal documentation, and would need a large amount of work to get it to run on other data.

To get started on time-series decoding, using one of the toolboxes is recommended (e.g., CoSMoMVPA: http://cosmomvpa.org/).
